# Payroll-system
This is my final project. The idea is about managing employees salary and attendance but currently i am working on Salary managememnt,
-How It works.
The user creates an Account and enter details about his company.
Then the system allows the user to access the dashboard where he can set up the payroll components.
User adds his/her employees with their respective basic salaries
Once all necessary information are filled the system calculates the Net salary for the employees.
After that the system may provide various reports upon the users request.
